# Weather Underground API MOTD

Simple script that I toss on all my Pi's to show me the current weather when I log in.

## Usage
You'll need to get an API key from WeatherUnderground:https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/
As of Feb 2nd 2019 it seems WeatherUnderground is no longer offering free API keys.
